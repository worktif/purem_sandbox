# 📊 Benchmark Documentation

This folder contains benchmark results and performance comparisons for Purem across multiple ML libraries (Purem, NumPy, PyTorch, Numba).

The included visualizations show:
- Acceleration ratios compared to other libraries
- Performance scaling across input sizes
- Stability and numerical consistency (optional)

These benchmarks are used to validate Purem’s production-level readiness and demonstrate measurable advantages in speed and throughput.

➡️ Graphs are stored under `/docs/assets`.

Note: These are **real-world tests** on CPU (ARM64), representing practical, production-like loads.
